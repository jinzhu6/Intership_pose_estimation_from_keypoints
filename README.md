#6DoF Pose estimation from keypoints

This code is the python adaptation of the matlab post processing you can find here : https://github.com/wbenbihi/hourglasstensorlfow
I also used the their neural network in an other repo.

I just translated the matlab code into python code, I did not invented anything
 
Feel free to use this code if you need it.

call main.py to create a figure with the cad projection on it. There is an exemple of the data you need in the folder images_test

The code is pretty simple to adapt, if you have question ask me.

The video maker is not very optimized, it saves all the frame, you can use it almost the same way than main.py
