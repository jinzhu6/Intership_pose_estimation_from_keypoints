#6DoF Pose estimation from keypoints

This code is the python adaptation of the matlab post processing you can find here : https://github.com/wbenbihi/hourglasstensorlfow
 
I just translated the matlab code into python code, I did not inveted anythink
 
Feel free to use this code if you need it.

call main.py to create a figure with the cad projection on it. There is an exemple of the data you need in the folder images_test

The code is pretty simple to adapt, if you have question ask me.
